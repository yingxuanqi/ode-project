# ODE-Based Vehicle Fuel Consumption & Range Optimization
This project models vehicle fuel consumption and achievable driving range under fixed fuel conditions using a simplified vehicle longitudinal dynamics model and an ODE-style fuel-mass depletion simulation. It explores:
- The existence of an optimal cruising speed that maximizes driving range (base case)
- The impact of wind and road grade on fuel consumption and range
- A local (±10%) local sensitivity analysis at a selected cruising speed
- A comparison between a Willans-line fuel model and an  model
